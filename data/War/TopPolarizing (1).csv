Bloodthirstinthissubredditismakingmesick_UkraineWarVideoReport,Post,350," I have been reading the comments on some posts here tonight and am apalled by the level of a lot of them  Many users here seem to be completely consumed by hatred and are advocating the most terrible and immoral things  The worst parts of some people are apparently flourishing among the currently very prevalent anti Russian sentiment  Many are showing themselves to be cheerleaders of death and destruction  propagating agendas of revenge and dehumanisation  Apparently these people are devoid of a sense of history or psychology  not to mention of simple moral values  An eye for an eye is as backwards as it gets  Be carefull with how easily you judge others without first trying to understand them  like those Russian soldiers and civilizians who support this war  Psychologically their positions are very complex  These people are more like us than unlike us  We are mostly just in different situations  To be better than their devilish masters is not as easy as it may seem ",Negative,Bloodthirst in this subreddit is making me sick,Bloodthirstinthissubredditismakingmesick_UkraineWarVideoReport,/r/UkraineWarVideoReport/comments/tdjufi/bloodthirst_in_this_subreddit_is_making_me_sick/
