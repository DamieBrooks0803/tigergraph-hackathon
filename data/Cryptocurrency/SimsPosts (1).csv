NanoisinfacttoogoodtobetruePleasedonttellyourlovedonestobuyitBlaringsecurityflawsandotherissuesinsidethisthread_CryptoCurrency,Post,315,,Positive,0,0.7394,CryptoCurrency," TL DR   Nano cannot survive nation bans like bitcoin can  the lightning network is a working product  When you tell friends and family to buy Nano  you are putting them in financial danger                   First and foremost  it is  wonderful  to have a product that works  right  I m sure we can agree with that  But what if you have a product that only works and has been working so long because of security flaws that nobody has noticed enough to exploit                    I advise you to check out this short 30 second video on using a non custodial bitcoin lightning wallet as it s much safer  much more secure  and it comes from the world s most popular crypto asset  Bitcoin  https www youtube com watch v AW 7XBrSqCI                 Well  what is the problem with Nano  Andreas Antonopolous has said this before on his YouTube channel in this video  The timestamp is 28 08  https www youtube com watch time continue 1688 amp v fEPW6RXMGmA amp feature emb title                 To paraphrase  He basically said that Nano hasn t been used at scale enough to compare with bitcoin  This means it s like the skinny guy at the gym who is 5 10   178cm  and 140 pounds  63 5KG  laughing at all the guys who are muscular but have a  little  difficulty benchpressing their own bodyweight  The skinny guy  in this example  can be thought of as Nano   the nano community because they think the big buff muscular guys struggling is funny even though they haven t had a chance to lift anything beyond the empty bar at all                   Six months after the above video was uploaded   streamed to Aantonopolous s channel  the Nano Network was given a nearly never ending spam attack that didn t change until the protocol at its core was changed                   Another blaring security flaw  Bitcoin survived the Chinese government mandated mining purge  Anything and everything cryptocurrency related in China is now illegal and that includes running a Nano node  There are less than 100 Nano node runners globally and if governments  internet service providers  or companies in general wanted to forcefully remove these individuals or entities from running a Nano node  they could do so with relative ease   however  when you take a bitcoin mining operation offline  there are always 10 people willing to rise up and take the place of that mining individual  When a nano node gets shut down  it gets shut down  There is no incentive to rise up and replace the node that was just shut down                      And then there is just systematic and uncontrollable brigading that comes from the Nano community  and it is lead on by the delusional belief that Nano is somehow superior to bitcoin  If you were to check out their subreddit  you would also quickly realize that not enough people are questioning the safety of the protocol  Oh  and let s not forget that Nano cannot work with smart contracts  So it can t do defy or swaps or anything like that                  Reaction to the delusional from the master himself on twitter  https imgur com a EPzTXYw                  Finally  this trend  must  be discussed  price action  In the 2017 bull run Bitcoin peaked at 20k USD while Nano peaked a month later at 35 USD  Bitcoin is now at 44 6k USD while Nano is at 2 USD  This is  not  self sustaining  and if this trend continues  the amount of bitcoin on the lightning network in USD will likely surpass Nano s total market cap in USD in under a year                    https www coingecko com en coins nano                    https www coingecko com en coins bitcoin                  https 1ml com    bitcoin on lightning stats                   EDIT  Running an optimal Nano node requires server grade hardware or renting a server and deploying a node on that server  You think an ISP or AWS or whatever cloud hosting platform won t shut it down if someone orders them to do it ",Positive,"Nano is  in fact  too good to be true  Please don t tell your loved ones to buy it  Blaring security flaws and other issues inside this thread ",NanoisinfacttoogoodtobetruePleasedonttellyourlovedonestobuyitBlaringsecurityflawsandotherissuesinsidethisthread_CryptoCurrency,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tpdyv8/nano_is_in_fact_too_good_to_be_true_please_dont/
