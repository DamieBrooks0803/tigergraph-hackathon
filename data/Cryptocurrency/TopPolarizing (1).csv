AbandonyourshitcoinsatthenextBTCATH_CryptoCurrency,Post,539,NFA but when you think about it in detail the chance that crypto moon shot gets you where you want to go is unlikely  Sure there might be one or two that rocket and makes your dreams come true  It can happen but its like going to the casino and hitting a jackpot  The sure ling term bets are Bitcoin and Eth  Not saying nothing else can make you money or that its hopeless  I am saying that if you have been sitting on some shitcoin for a bit specially if you bought at ATH that coin is likely to be totally  dependent on Bitcoin   ETH and global market cap   I have a few shitcoins I just don t ever want to see in my portfolio again and can t wait to trade for BTC and or ETH  Yes I understand my profits will be less when crypto goes parabolic  My BTC   ETH earnings might be less than if I held a shitcoin but the longevity and legitimacy aspect of the power coins will give me peace of mind   Yes we d all like the crypto moon shot but I m going to move safe going forward  Just my 2 cents,Positive,"Abandon your shitcoins at the next BTC ATH ",AbandonyourshitcoinsatthenextBTCATH_CryptoCurrency,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/trtmxz/abandon_your_shitcoins_at_the_next_btc_ath/
