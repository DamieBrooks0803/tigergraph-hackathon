# tigergraph-hackathon
In today’s hyper-digital world, algorithms determine what content we see. Narratives are forced upon us into an echo chamber. Confirmation Bias is the concept that when we see something that reinforces our current thinking, we are more inclined to believe and accept that as truth. In this graph challenge, we create a solution that empowers users to consider diverse perspectives and in turn – fosters critical thinking. 

For this Tiger Graph challenge, we extract post listings from Reddit across the entire community. We apply similarity and sentiment analysis to look for patterns.

Using these findings, we can run custom graph queries and traversals across our graph solution to suggest other posts that are relevant but different in their mood or subreddit community.

Offering diverse and alternative perspectives can break confirmation bias and foster critical thinking - allowing users to think for themselves.

The project involves: 
  - Tiger Graph
  - Python
  - Graphistry
  - Jupyter notebook
  - Reddit
